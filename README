ksc tool
========
A tool to check stablelist symbol usage in  kernel module source code.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                        path to configuration file
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY
                        path to the directory
  -i, --internal        to create text files to be used internally
  -k KO, --ko=KO        path to the ko file
  -n RELEASENAME, --name=RELEASENAME
                        Red Hat release against which the bug is to be filed. Default value is 7.0
  -p PREVIOUS, --previous=PREVIOUS
                        path to previous resultset to submit as bug
  -r RELEASE, --release=RELEASE
                        RHEL stablelist release to compare against
  -y SYMVERS, --symvers=SYMVERS
                        Path to the Module.symvers file. The current kernel
                        path is used if not specified.
  -s, --submit          Submit to Red Hat Bugzilla
  -v, --version         Prints KSC version number

Valid architectures for binary modules are x86_64, ppc64, s390x.
The total symbol usage number will vary depending on which architecture it is running
against as it depends on the symbols provided by Red Hat kernel on that
architecture.

Example command and output:

$ ksc  -d ../drivers/ipw2200-1.1.4


Total symbol usage: 71  Total Non stable list symbol usage: 3
Score: 95.77%
